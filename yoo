complete react code to display all pokemons using pokeapi, and when clicked on a pokemon it should display his details informations

Here's a sample React code to display all the Pokemons using PokeAPI and display their details on click:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [pokemons, setPokemons] = useState([]);
  const [selectedPokemon, setSelectedPokemon] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPokemons(data.results))
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  }, []);

  const handlePokemonClick = url => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setSelectedPokemon(data))
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Pokemons</h1>
      <ul>
        {pokemons.map(pokemon => (
          <li key={pokemon.url} onClick={() => handlePokemonClick(pokemon.url)}>
            {pokemon.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {selectedPokemon && (
        <div>
          <h2>{selectedPokemon.name}</h2>
          <img src={selectedPokemon.sprites.front_default} alt={selectedPokemon.name} />
          <p>Height: {selectedPokemon.height}</p>
          <p>Weight: {selectedPokemon.weight}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
First, we use the useState hook to keep track of the list of Pokemons and the selected Pokemon. We use the useEffect hook to fetch the list of Pokemons from the PokeAPI when the component mounts. Then, we display the list of Pokemons using the map function and attach a click event to each item that will fetch the details of the selected Pokemon and update the state.

Finally, if a Pokemon is selected, we display its details in a separate section. We use the selectedPokemon state to conditionally render this section.

Here's the explanation of the provided React code:

First, we import the useState and useEffect hooks from the react library. We also import the axios library to make HTTP requests to the PokeAPI.

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
Then, we define a functional component called PokemonList that will render a list of all Pokemons. We use the useState hook to initialize the state with an empty array of Pokemons.

jsx
Copy code
function PokemonList() {
  const [pokemons, setPokemons] = useState([]);
We use the useEffect hook to fetch the list of Pokemons from the PokeAPI when the component mounts. We make a GET request to the /pokemon endpoint of the API and update the state with the received data.

jsx
Copy code
  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon')
      .then(response => setPokemons(response.data.results))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);
We render the list of Pokemons using the map function. Each Pokemon is displayed as a clickable div element with its name.

jsx
Copy code
  return (
    <div>
      {pokemons.map(pokemon => (
        <div key={pokemon.name} onClick={() => handlePokemonClick(pokemon.url)}>
          {pokemon.name}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
When a Pokemon is clicked, we use the handlePokemonClick function to fetch its details from the PokeAPI and update the state with the received data. We make a GET request to the url property of the clicked Pokemon and update the state with the received data.

jsx
Copy code
  function handlePokemonClick(url) {
    axios.get(url)
      .then(response => setPokemons([response.data]))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }
}
Overall, this React code uses the useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and display the list of Pokemons from the PokeAPI, and updates the state to display the details of the selected Pokemon when clicked.

Great! Here's an example code snippet that you can use to handle the click event and fetch the details of the selected Pokemon from the PokeAPI:

jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function PokemonList() {
  const [pokemonList, setPokemonList] = useState([]);
  const [selectedPokemon, setSelectedPokemon] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20').then((response) => {
      setPokemonList(response.data.results);
    });
  }, []);

  const handlePokemonClick = (pokemon) => {
    axios.get(pokemon.url).then((response) => {
      setSelectedPokemon(response.data);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {pokemonList.map((pokemon) => (
          <li key={pokemon.name} onClick={() => handlePokemonClick(pokemon)}>
            {pokemon.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {selectedPokemon && (
        <div>
          <h2>{selectedPokemon.name}</h2>
          <img src={selectedPokemon.sprites.front_default} alt={selectedPokemon.name} />
          <p>Height: {selectedPokemon.height}</p>
          <p>Weight: {selectedPokemon.weight}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default PokemonList;
This code defines a function component PokemonList that uses the useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and display the list of Pokemons, and updates the state to display the details of the selected Pokemon when clicked. The handlePokemonClick function handles the click event and fetches the details of the selected Pokemon from the PokeAPI using the axios library. The details of the selected Pokemon are then displayed using conditional rendering.

Sure! Here's some more information on the React code you mentioned:

The useState hook is used to declare a state variable called pokemonList, which is initialized as an empty array. The useEffect hook is used to fetch the list of Pokemons from the PokeAPI when the component mounts, and updates the pokemonList state variable with the fetched data.

When a Pokemon is clicked, the handlePokemonClick function is called with the name of the selected Pokemon as a parameter. This function uses the axios library to make a GET request to the PokeAPI to fetch the details of the selected Pokemon. Once the data is fetched, it updates the selectedPokemon state variable with the fetched data.

The PokemonList function component uses conditional rendering to display either the list of Pokemons or the details of the selected Pokemon, depending on the value of the selectedPokemon state variable. If selectedPokemon is null, it displays the list of Pokemons, otherwise it displays the details of the selected Pokemon.

Overall, the React code uses state and effect hooks, along with conditional rendering, to fetch and display data from the PokeAPI.
